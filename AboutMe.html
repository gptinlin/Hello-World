            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>One of my favorite things to do is hang out with my friends and family. One of the reasons I moved to San Diego was to be closer to them. Another interesting thing about me is that I love sports. Whether that is playing them or watching them. It was something that I did with my dad growing up and I have enjoyed it ever since. I played <strong>college football</strong> for 2 years in Southern California and it was an amazing experience.</p>
